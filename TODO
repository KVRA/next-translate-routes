[] validate custom pagesTree
[] handle translated urls with locale prefix
[] example folder based on next.js/example/with-i18n
[] verify that automatic redirects/rewrites can be overwritten
[] improve comments, documentation
[] trow helpful errors (ex: for `compile(path)(augmentedQuery)` in case the query parameters for a dynamic segment is missing)
[] dig around client side redirects and rewrites
[] getRouteList: (locale?: string) => (? Record<string, string[]> ? string[] ? string[][] ?)
[] compact redirects:
  - `source: '/(en)/(french|spanish)/path'` instead of `/(en)/french/path` and `/(en)/spanish/path`
  - `source: '/(en)/french/:path*'
[] create a function `getRouteSegments(filePath: string): TRouteSegment[]`
  - return the whole path as is if not found and not dynamic file path
