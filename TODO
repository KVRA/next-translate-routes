[] validate custom pagesTree
[] improve comments, documentation, readme (motivations, use case)
[] trow helpful errors (ex: for `compile(path)(augmentedQuery)` in case the query parameters for a dynamic segment is missing)
[] dig around client side redirects and rewrites
[] compact redirects:
  - `source: '/(en)/(french|spanish)/path'` instead of `/(en)/french/path` and `/(en)/spanish/path`
  - `source: '/(en)/french/:path*'
[] create a function `getRouteSegments(filePath: string): TRouteSegment[]`
  - return the whole path as is if not found and not dynamic file path
  - export a routeExist function
